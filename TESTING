Testing notes:

Grab the latest tarball from here:

http://snapshots.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/libstatgrab-0.90-rc2.tar.gz

Although not required to build, run and test libstatgrab, it may be
useful for debugging to have log4cplus installed. It can be found
at the page below. Don't worry if you can't install it, we can use the
stderr logging if a problem occurs.

http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net/

Finally, to run saidar, the ncurses header files need to be available.
Depending on your OS you may need to add these - on Linux it might be
in an ncurses-dev package.

To test libstatgrab perform the following steps:

Extract and build:

tar -zxvf libstatgrab-0.90-rc2.tar.gz
cd libstatgrab-0.90-rc2
./configure
make
make test

If all the tests pass without problems the next step is to run
statgrab and saidar (saidar is only built if ncurses was available):

./src/statgrab/statgrab
./src/saidar/saidar

A brief inspection of the output is useful. Saidar is better for this
because everything is usually visible on one screen, but statgrab
gives mored detailed information. Just check the numbers look right,
and everything you'd expect to see listed is present.

If this all went well, it would be useful to do any of the following
that you have time for:

- test with another compiler. clang? gcc? commercial alternative?
- test a 32-bit build on a 64-bit machine, using -m32 or equivalent
- test on other operating systems and/or versions

Finally, report back to us all the successful test cases.

If you find problems we may need to dig further. A good starting point
is to send us the output from the tests that fail, along with the
config.log file, and logging output (compile with --enable-logging if
log4cplus wasn't available and log output will be sent to stderr). And
of course, let us know the operating system version and hardware type.

Thank you for testing.
