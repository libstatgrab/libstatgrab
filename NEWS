PLANS: We're now working towards a 1.0 release which is where we plan
       to stabilise the API. We'll be doing test releases before hand,
       but as always we'll like to hear about any bugs found in the
       current release.

libstatgrab 0.92.1 (27 July 2021)
 * Fix build with autoconf 2.70+.
 * Fix CPU stats on older Linux kernels.
 * Make sure to count processes in an unknown state.
 * Check if -ltinfo is needed when linking ncurses.
 * Fixes to build when cross-compiling.
 * Fix build with -DNDEBUG.
 * Handle vmmeter changes in FreeBSD 12.

libstatgrab 0.92 (16 July 2019)
 * Fix various file descriptor leaks.
 * On Linux, read process thread name from comm where available (fixes
   FreeScale ARM BSP).
 * Add more process stat information on MacOS/Darwin.
 * Fix build on Alpine Linux and NetBSD 8.
 * Fix build on FreeBSD 12 without COMPAT_FREEBSD11.
 * Improve collection of data for non-standard Solaris interfaces.
 * Improve detection of interface link status on Solaris.
 * Various configure and build fixes.
 * Ensure modern log4cplus is used correctly.

libstatgrab 0.91 (11 July 2014)
 * Use /proc/mounts on Linux where available. Note that this
   potentially results in different data appearing in the filesystem
   statistics. To override the choice use the --with-mnttab configure
   flag.
 * Add a new field named device_canonical to the filesystem statistics.
   This always holds the real device and is useful in the case where
   device_name is a symlink.
 * Fix list miscounting in sg_set_valid_filesystems.
 * Fix buffer overrun when dealing with a larger number of processes.
 * Fix divide by zero display problem in saidar.
 * Building of examples is now disabled by default. Use the
   --enable-examples configure flag to build them if required.
 * Logging (log4cplus) is now only enabled if the --enable-logging
   configure flag is given.
 * When logging with log4cplus is enabled, properties files are
   installed in to ${prefix}/etc. Both statgrab and saidar will search
   this location when starting up. These files can be used to
   configure the behaviour of log4cplus.
 * Add Graphite output support in statgrab.
     (Thanks to John Lyman)
 * Fix test suite problem when doing a VPATH build.
 * Install distribution documentation (such as this file) in to
   ${prefix}/share/doc/libstatgrab.
 * Various other minor bug fixes identified by compiler warnings.
 * Update code for the Windows platform. This is incomplete, but we
   included the changes to give anyone else working in this area a
   better starting point. We welcome pull requests to further improve
   this code. The original pull request can be found in #36.
     (Thanks to Brent Cook)

libstatgrab 0.90 (08 August 2013)
 * Please note the API in 0.90 has changed, so applications using
   libstatgrab will need to be updated to support the changes.

 * API unification (every stats call is now able to return multiple entries).
 * Complete rewrite of internal memory management (eases future extensions).
 * Add experimental support for tracing using log4cplus.
 * Complete the ports for AIX, HP-UX and most of the widely used
   BSD-based operating systems.
